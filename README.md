## Predictive Exploratory Analysis: Case Study Microsoft Company
### Business Problem
Microsoft sees many big companies creating original video content and want to establish their own movie studio to compete within the digital content market.

To assist Microsoft in solving this problem, I will consider:

a. How many movies are being made of each genre?
b. What genres are the most successful, in terms of gross earnings?
c. Of the top grossing films, which genres were most successful (had the highest gross earnings)?
Answering these questions will allow Microsoft to better decide what kind of movies to create in order to match its competitors.
