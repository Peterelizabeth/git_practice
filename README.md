# Business Problem
Microsoft sees many big companies creating original video content and want to establish their own movie studio to compete within the digital content market.

To assist Microsoft in solving this problem, I will consider:

a. How many movies are being made of each genre?
b. What genres are the most successful, based on earnings?
c. Of the top grossing films, which genres were most successful (had the highest gross earnings)?

Answering these questions will allow Microsoft to develop a better understanding and decide on what kind of movies to create for the new movies shop in order to match its competitors.

# Data Understanding
The data for this analysis have come from:

a. IMDb (title basics, title rating)
b. Box Office Mojo (movie title, gross earnings, year)

The target variables for this analysis are gross earnings, genres, and audience ratings. These variables are all important and necessary to address Microsoftâ€™s business problem. Gross earnings, and release year are numeric variables (though gross earnings is continuous) and genres are categorical.
